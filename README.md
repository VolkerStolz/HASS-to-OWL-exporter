# Instructions

0. Ignore the `Makefile`
1. Create a file `config.py` with:
```
hass_url = "http://your.do.main:8123/api/"
hass_token = "..."
```
2. Run `hacvt.py`, grab generated file and import e.g. into Protégé. You may need to tweak the filename in the code.

# Notes

- `services.csv` is generated from the `Makefile`, but checked into the repo for convenience.
 Requires to have `homeassisstant` checked out in here.
