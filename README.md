# Instructions

0. Ignore the `Makefile`
1. Set up a 'venc` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `hacvt.py` with options of your choice (needs at least URL and variable that holds your long-lived access token)
3. Grab generated file (`ha.ttl` by default) and import e.g. into [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu).
